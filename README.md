# Manipulator Toolbox

Description
---
This toolbox is a user interface to create an 'n' link robot on the GUI to its behaviour in terms of rotation matrices, workspace plots, forward and inverse kinematics, dynamics, etc. on MATLAB using app developer.

Usage
---
Please refer to ```./manual``` folder on how to use it.
